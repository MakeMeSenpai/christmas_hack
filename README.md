# Christmas Light Music Hack!

The goal of this project is to be able to apply past robotic with current coding. This is helpful 
to help expand my knowledge, as well as make a really cool decorative program! We will be hacking 
Christmas lights in this project in order to make it react to noise. But in order to do this, we 
must ask the question, what is noise? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0 ,

Noise is a vibration in which our coachella vibrates hairs and fluid in a long tube for our brain
to exame. But that isn't the important part of what you have learn today. I found a recource using
numpy in order to take noisy data and make conditionals out of frequencies. Just what we needed!

the above is the book, while the bottom is the example code we will be using.

# After lots of research
I looked everywhere for information. And tho I learned a lot from these recourse, it is not enough 
to learn how to process audio in python. Or how to translate that into hardware for those of us
who never touched a circute board in our lives. This has been a difficult challenge, however I'm 
too excited for the end result to give up now.

**Shopping List:**
-Microphone Sound Sensor Module High Sensitivity Voice Detection Sensor []
-Audrino Uno rev3 []
-christmas lights check out https://mods-n-hacks.gadgethacks.com/how-to/
hack-christmas-lights-for-custom-holiday-lighting-patterns-0122784/ and more for selection. We 
will be using ones specifically with color cordination or with id's for each light buld like the 
link provided []
-Look up more things such as extra wires, and computer chip wiring []

**TODO:**
Skateboard: Use python to understand sound. When sound can be accepted the skateboard is complete. 
The sound can come from a music file for now, but will later it will be required that the sound 
comes from an external source, and the input is being taken from a microphone []

Bike: The program now uses certain frequencies to perform certain tasks. The bike is complete when 
you can make conditionals based off of sound, and can accept input from a microphone All parts 
needed are bought and ready for soldering. []

Car: Program is downloaded onto our robots brain! Lights are connected to arduino and other 
robotic parts, and flashes whenever it hears a sound. Conditionals should make it so that it only 
flashes to certain frequencies and how loud the sound it. []

Stretch Limo: The lights flash different colors depending on the frequency, colors are brighter 
when the sound is louder and dimmer when the sound is quiet. The robotics can be easily accessed 
and should lie in a safe and tiny compartment as for solid and easy transportation. (as well as 
safety!!) []
